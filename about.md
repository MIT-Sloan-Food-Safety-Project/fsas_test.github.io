I am the type of person that lets my curiosity lead.  I have found every field I've studied fascinating, from history to psychology to statistics to rhetoric to policy.  I am the type of person who appreciates the telling of a great story.  For that reason, I consider myself more an curious person than a data scientist; interested in difficult problems and the steady making of progress on them.

As a data scientist, I am interested in machine learning, experimental design and leveraging the potential of data sources typically seen as too unstructured or noisy to be useful.  As a collector of stories, I am proficient at finding the narrative in data.

I have worked in scientific research for a decade in the areas of public health and policy, psychology, quantitative applications to qualitative data (e.g. NLP) and machine learning.  I am actively pursuing new opportunities to learn and have impact through data science methodologies.
