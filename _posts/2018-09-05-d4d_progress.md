title: Progress on D4D project
---

I wanted to share some recent recognition the D4D Crash model project (now referred to as [Insight Lane](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/crash-model)) has been making in recent months.  First, we [released version 1](https://medium.com/data-for-democracy/d4d-project-highlight-the-data-for-democracy-crash-model-c99c004ce35c) of our project, whooo! 

Then we got [written up in Government Technology](http://www.govtech.com/civic/Data-for-Democracy-Works-to-Expand-Its-Crash-Risk-Model-Nationwide.html) magazine and blog.  The article outlines a bit about our strategy and our plans for the future.  If you're interested in learning more about what we're working on for version 2 of the project, [check it out on Github](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/crash-model/projects/9).

One of our core volunteers, Terry Franklin, also wrote [an excellent article](https://medium.com/data-for-democracy/insight-lane-seven-steps-to-an-effective-volunteer-data-science-project-6f3cd6761e92) about our strategy for making this project one of the longest-running volunteer projects D4D has ever had! Check it out, I think it has some really valuable insights.

There's definitely more to come on this project.  Join us if you're interested, or if you just want to hear us get excited about data sources.
