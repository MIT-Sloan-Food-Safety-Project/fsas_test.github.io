title: Data challenge code
---

Some bonus good news: I put up a [data challenge](https://github.com/bpben/data_challenge) I did for an application.  And whether or not they think it's worth hiring me over, you all get to peruse the code.  I have some neatly formatted visualization and gridsearch code in there, if you want to try those out.
