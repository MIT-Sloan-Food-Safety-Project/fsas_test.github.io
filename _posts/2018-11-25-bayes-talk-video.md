title: Video of ODSC presentation on hierarchical modeling
---

Great news! I just uploaded [a recording of my talk at ODSC Europe](https://youtu.be/2ym4fzPfraw).  Again, slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JpPHuF8xOeZEgmPkNB8IXGie0gFpGgwdP-SgNMMHozI/edit?usp=sharing).

Feel free to get in touch if you have comments.  Kind of new to putting things up on Youtube and can't say comments on there have the best reputation...
