title: Series on interpretability in Machine Learning 
---

Hi internets,

Lots of static here, sorry about all that.  I'll be trying to update a bit more often.  Mainly when I think about blogging, I spend my time on the fancy new [ThriveHive Tech Blog](http://tech.thrivehive.com/).  In fact I just finished a three-part series on interpretability in machine learning.  Check out part one [here](http://tech.thrivehive.com/2018/06/11/interpreting-machine-learning-models-picking-low-hanging-business-insights-part-1-linear-thinking/).

More to come!
