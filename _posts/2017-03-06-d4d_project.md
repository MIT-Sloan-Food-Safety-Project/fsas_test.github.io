title: Data 4 Democracy project
---

Hello internet fans! Just wanted to add a quick update that I'm working on an interesting project with the [Data 4 Democracy](https://medium.com/data-for-democracy) folks.  [Check it out](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/boston-crash-modeling).

The purpose here is to build a predictive model for accidents in Boston as part of the [Vision Zero campaign](http://www.visionzeroboston.org/).  This will involve road features, historical crash data and [citizen comments](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/vision-zero-entry).  There's [a lot](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856410000376) of interesting work that has been done in this area, and we're hoping to draw on some of that to build our model.  

My main involvement is data wrangling and building a benchmark model.  The main event will be coming up later in the form of a hackathon.  Everyone loves hackathons.  Will keep my anxious public updated.
