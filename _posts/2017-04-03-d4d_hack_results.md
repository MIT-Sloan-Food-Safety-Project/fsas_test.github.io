title: Results of the D4D hackathon
---

Thanks to all the awesome people at [Data 4 Democracy](http://datafordemocracy.org/), MIT and [data.world](https://data.world/) we pulled off a great hackathon.  If you want to see some of the participants showing off their work (and my total lack of MC-ing ability) [check us out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2MIWV6X6bM)!

Mainly we focused on the crash modelling project in boston and you can take a look at some of the [data generation and benchmark work](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/boston-crash-modeling).  Make sure to add it to your watch list as we're likely going to see some neat improvements coming down the line.

Projects were not just limited to crash modelling and you can take a look at [some of the other projects github repos](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/).
