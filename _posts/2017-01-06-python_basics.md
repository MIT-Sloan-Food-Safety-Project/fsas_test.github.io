title: Basic python lesson
---

There's a small chance I may be doing some part-time data science instructoring, so I put together a very basic tutorial for those just getting started with Python (or programming generally).  [Check it out](https://github.com/bpben/python_lessons)!

I'm hoping to add to this and create additional lessons for different levels of developers and scientists.  There's definitely a few lessons I've learned over the years that I'd like to get out there.
