Hi internet friends! I put together a [small tutorial](https://github.com/bpben/python_lessons/blob/master/inspecting_311_data_tutorial.ipynb) using pandas and some API wizardry to do simple analysis.  I use [open data from Boston](https://data.cityofboston.gov/City-Services/311-Service-Requests/awu8-dc52) and the [Wunderground API](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/) and deal with data manipulation, joining and testing.  The issues I faced here are similar to the issues I face daily in my work, so I hope it's useful for all you fresh-faced data scientists.
