title: PyData Probabilistic Modelling Workshop video
---

Very late on the update, but [the video for Matt and my workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAdHn17IyqA) was posted on the PyData Youtube channel.  Check out the rest of the materials on [this post](https://bpben.github.io/2018/10/18/pydata-workshop/).

It was a really awesome opportunity and a great, engaged crowd.  They even tolerated my occasional (frequent) slip-ups.  Big props to the PyData community, they run an awesome conference.
