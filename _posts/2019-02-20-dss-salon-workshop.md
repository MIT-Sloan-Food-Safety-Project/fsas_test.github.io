title: NLP Workshop at Data Science Salon
---

I'll be running a workshop tomorrow (Feb 21st) at the [Data Science Salon](https://datascience.salon/austin/) in Austin.  Will be really interested, excited to chat with everyone during and after.

Slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pQ573Qb8X8u33jfeO7gzoxgAmTds-7hT-ijMVx7r3RY/edit#slide=id.g4b3203d3ab_0_107).  Lots of additional material here.  I think I may have gotten a bit overexcited about the topic...
