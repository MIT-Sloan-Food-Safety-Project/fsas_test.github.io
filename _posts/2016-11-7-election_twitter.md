title: Doing a mini-project
---

I'm updating my poorly organized/documented [twittertools](https://github.com/bpben/twittertools).  Turns out [Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) isn't being maintained anymore, so I will be switching to [python twitter tools](https://github.com/sixohsix/twitter).  Get excited, I have some election-related project in the works (and who doesn't....)
