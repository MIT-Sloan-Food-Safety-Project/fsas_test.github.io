title: Hierarchical Modelling in Real Life at PyData NYC
---

It's conference season huzzah! My friend [Matt Moocarme](http://www.mattmoocar.me/) and I will be giving a workshop on hierarchical probabilistic models tomorrow at [PyData NYC](https://pydata.org/nyc2018/).  It's based on the methods I described in [my talk at ODSC](https://bpben.github.io/2018/09/21/bayes-talk-slides/) last month, but now with some actual code and the ability to run it all on your own personal machine.  No fuss, no muss.

And you, my faithful blog followers, get a sneak peek at the materials for tomorrow.

The github repo is [here](https://github.com/moocarme/pydata_2018).

See the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D3ShwnpDIgFzHMiLJjLPanSn0_QpHGf7R6eCygkjCIc).

I'll update once the recordings go up.  It should be a blast.  Feel free to reach out with comments/questions.

- Ben
