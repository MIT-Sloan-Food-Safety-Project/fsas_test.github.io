title: Bayesian Hierarchical modeling talk
---

I'll be giving a talk at ODSC Europe tomorrow (2018-09-22) on Bayesian Hierarchical modeling and an application at my work.  Should be really interesting.  I'm putting the slides up here now, so everyone should be able to access them.  Let me know if you have questions by tweeting [@bpben2](https://twitter.com/bpben2).

Slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JpPHuF8xOeZEgmPkNB8IXGie0gFpGgwdP-SgNMMHozI/edit?usp=sharing).

Excited to give this talk! Should be an interesting discussion coming out of it.
