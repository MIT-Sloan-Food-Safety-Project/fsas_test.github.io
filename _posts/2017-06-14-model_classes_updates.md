Sorry for the radio silence, I recently started a job as Data Scientist for [ThriveHive](https://thrivehive.com/), a SaaS company providing managed marketing for small businesses.  It's super interesting, and hopefully I'll have more to share as we start launching new products.

In the meantime, I've been making tweaks to my [model helpers](https://github.com/bpben/model_helpers) which I've found really useful for developing models in my new position.  Namely, I added [XGBoost](http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) support.  This is mainly made possible by the awesome contributors to the XGBoost project for making it play well with sklearn.

I welcome any suggestions you have for these classes.  I'd love to make them into something a bit more robust.  I'll post updates as I make them.

See you next time!
