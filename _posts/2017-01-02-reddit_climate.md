title: Reddit climate project
---

Just [posted an exercise](https://github.com/bpben/reddit_climate) I did with reddit data and characterizing the conversation around climate change.  What was super interesting was using the [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/) library, which allows you to build some awesome network diagrams with fairly minimal pre-processing.  I'll post it up next.

The election project I was going to do might be on permanent hiatus.  I saw ODSC's George McIntire's [analysis](https://www.opendatascience.com/blog/twitter-on-election-night-an-analysis/) and got a little self-conscious.  

I still will post up some helper functions for Twitter, as I found it kind of difficult to navigate [python twitter tools](https://github.com/sixohsix/twitter).

Stay tuned!
