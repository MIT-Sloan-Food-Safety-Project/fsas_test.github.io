It's happening, people! The [Data 4 Democracy (with a little help from City of Boston) hackathon](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/data-for-democracy-hackathon-boston-tickets-33088552752?aff=es2).  If you're in the Boston area or a fan of the Boston area or, heck, if you just got nothing better to do on a Saturday, check it out.

I know my audience is pretty international at this point (haha), so I'll also mention this hackathon has a bunch of [other locations](https://www.eventbrite.com/d/worldwide/data-for-democracy/?crt=regular&sort=best) across the US and is open to remote entry.  Check out [data.world](https://data.world/data4democracy) for a list of projects/datasets.

I'm continuing to work on the [data generation process](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/boston-crash-modeling) and some benchmark analysis.  I'll update once I have a benchmark I'm not totally ashamed of.
